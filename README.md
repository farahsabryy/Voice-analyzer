# Voice Spectrum Analyzer using MATLAB

## Project Overview
This MATLAB-based Voice Spectrum Analyzer provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing voice signals. The project includes real-time audio recording, signal analysis in both time and frequency domains, and energy spectrum visualization.

## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Recording:** Record voice signals with adjustable sampling frequency and duration.
- **Time-Domain Visualization:** Display the recorded signal in the time domain.
- **Frequency-Domain Analysis:** Perform frequency analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- **Energy Spectrum:** Visualize the energy distribution of the signal.
- **Playback Functionality:** Play back the recorded signal.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (if applicable)

## Project Structure

## Usage Instructions
1. Launch the GUI by running the `voiceCapture.m` script.
2. Set the desired sampling frequency and duration for the recording.
3. Click **Start** to begin recording.
4. Stop the recording and view the signal analysis in real-time.
5. Use the **Play** button to listen to the recorded audio.

## Future Work
- Implement advanced signal processing algorithms.
- Enhance the GUI for better user experience.
- Allow for external file import and export.
